## PROBLEM : In this assignment weâ€™ll track luggage through an airline from Kansas City, (MCI) to Honolulu
## (HNL).
##
## ALGORITHM : 
##      1. Create variable rounds
##      2. Check if rounds > 0
##      3. while rounds > 0, run loop to check for probability of luggage destination
##      4. Print out probability and ask user if they would like to run again
## 
## ERROR HANDLING:
##      -Warn user they must have input greater than 0 for variable rounds
##      -Warn user they must enter "y, yes, n, or no" for variable run_again
##
